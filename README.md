# Java_SE_Course
Project to review Java and learn new features.

## What is Java?

Java is a high level programming language (although not as high as Python or JavaScript) that helps us build applications for different devices and operating systems.

It was created in 1991 by James Gosling while working at Sun Microsystems, a company that was later acquired by Oracle. This means that Java has very good maintenance, but also some changes that we will not all agree with.

Java has two categories: Standard Edition for building desktop or console applications and Enterprise Edition for companies to work with the latest web applications.

In this course we will learn the basics of Java Standard Edition: language syntax, declare variables, work with functions, cycles and conditionals, programming logic, algorithms and many other things.

But do not worry. Java follows the philosophy of Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), so everything you read in this document can also be applied with Java EE.
