Project to review Java and learn new features.

## What is Java?

Java is a high level programming language (although not as high as Python or JavaScript) that helps us build applications for different devices and operating systems.

It was created in 1991 by James Gosling while working at Sun Microsystems, a company that was later acquired by Oracle. This means that Java has very good maintenance, but also some changes that we will not all agree with.

Java has two categories: Standard Edition for building desktop or console applications and Enterprise Edition for companies to work with the latest web applications.

In this course we will learn the basics of Java Standard Edition: language syntax, declare variables, work with functions, cycles and conditionals, programming logic, algorithms and many other things.

But do not worry. Java follows the philosophy of Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), so everything you read in this document can also be applied with Java EE.

## Java and JDK versions
The JDK or Java Development Kit consists of the following elements:

Java Runtime Environment (JRE): The Java virtual machine, which allows us to write the same code to work the same on all devices and operating systems.
Java compiler: Responsible for translating our code in Java into a language that can understand and interpret our virtual machine.
Development APIs: A code base ready to help us develop.
Java development APIs have evolved over time, so there are different versions of java that you can use. The version that most raised the popularity and job offers with Java was Java SE 6.

In Java SE 9 they announced that updates would occur every 6 months, but LTS (Long Time Support) versions will be maintained for 3 years, so updates are necessary, but not urgent.

In this course we are going to work with the Java SE 11 LTS version, the first licensed version of Java. We can only use it for free when working in development and testing environments. Otherwise, we must pay USD 2.5 per month per desktop user and USD 25 per processor for server applications.

Fortunately, OpenJDK is a free and open source version of using Java SE Platform Edition.
